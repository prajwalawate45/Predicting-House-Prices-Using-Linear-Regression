# Linear Regression Model in Python
# Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (main_Linear_Regression.ipynb) that demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression using Python. The notebook covers essential steps including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.


Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predictive modeling, where the relationship between dependent and independent variables is analyzed. This project serves as an educational resource for understanding and applying Linear Regression in real-world scenarios.

# Features
**📊 Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature selection, and data normalization.


**📈 Simple & Multiple Linear Regression:** Implementing regression for single and multiple predictor variables.


**🔍 Model Evaluation:** Using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R² score to assess performance.


**📉 Data Visualization:** Plotting regression lines, residuals, and model predictions for better interpretation.


**🚀 Scikit-learn Implementation:** Utilizing the LinearRegression module from scikit-learn for efficient model training.
